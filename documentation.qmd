The own-wage elasticity (OWE) of employment measures the proportional change in a group's employment caused by a minimum wage increase, divided by the proportional change in that groupâ€™s average wage.

The **Minimum Wage Own-Wage Elasticity Repository** contains a representative 
estimate of the OWE of employment from every minimum wage study published 
since 1992, with the following restrictions:

1. the study must evaluate the employment effects of changes in the statutory
minimum wage

1. the study must estimate a statistically significant, positive wage effect of the
minimum wage, in addition to estimating the employment effect, for the same group of workers using a similar research design

1. the study must be published after 1992 and include "quasi-experimental" 
or "experimental" variations

1. studies older than 10 years must have been published in an academic journal

1. the study must focus on the United States, United Kingdom, countries in the
European Union, or Canada (we will eventually relax this restriction)

The current version of the repository,  Version `r data_version`, contains 
`r study_count` studies, `r published_study_count` of which are published 
in peer-reviewed journals. A description of Version 1.0 of the repository 
is in the paper
