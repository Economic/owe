Do you know of a study we should add? Did we not select the most appropriate elasticities from a given paper?

Please email [benzipperer@gmail.com](mailto:benzipperer@gmail.com?subject=Own-wage elasticity database) or file an issue at the underlying [Github repository](https://github.com/Economic/owe/issues).

We welcome feedback and will continue to update the database with new studies.
